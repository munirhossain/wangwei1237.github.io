                                <h1 id="171-running-tasks-with-the-job-resource">17.1 Running tasks with the Job resource</h1>
<p>Before you create your first Pod via the Job resource, let&#x2019;s think about the Pods in the kiada Namespace. They&#x2019;re all meant to run continuously. When a container in one of these pods terminates, it&#x2019;s automatically restarted. When the Pod is deleted, it&#x2019;s recreated by the controller that created the original Pod. For example, if you delete one of the kiada pods, it&#x2019;s quickly recreated by the Deployment controller because the replicas field in the kiada Deployment specifies that three Pods should always exist.</p>
<p>Now consider a Pod whose job is to initialize the MongoDB database. You don&#x2019;t want it to run continuously; you want it to perform one task and then exit. Although you want the Pod&#x2019;s containers to restart if they fail, you don&#x2019;t want them to restart when they finish successfully. You also don&#x2019;t want a new Pod to be created after you delete the Pod that completed its task.</p>
<p>You may recall that you already created such a Pod in chapter 15, namely the quiz-data-importer Pod. It was configured with the OnFailure restart policy to ensure that the container would restart only if it failed. When the container terminated successfully, the Pod was finished, and you could delete it. Since you created this Pod directly and not through a Deployment, StatefulSet or DaemonSet, it wasn&#x2019;t recreated. So, what&#x2019;s wrong with this approach and why would you create the Pod via a Job instead?</p>
<p>To answer this question, consider what happens if someone accidentally deletes the Pod prematurely or if the Node running the Pod fails. In these cases, Kubernetes wouldn&#x2019;t automatically recreate the Pod. You&#x2019;d have to do that yourself. And you&#x2019;d have to watch that Pod from creation to completion. That might be fine for a Pod that completes its task in seconds, but you probably don&#x2019;t want to be stuck watching a Pod for hours. So, it&#x2019;s better to create a Job object and let Kubernetes do the rest.</p>
<h2 id="1711-introducing-the-job-resource">17.1.1 Introducing the Job resource</h2>
<p>The Job resource resembles a Deployment in that it creates one or more Pods, but instead of ensuring that those Pods run indefinitely, it only ensures that a certain number of them complete successfully.</p>
<p>As you can see in the following figure, the simplest Job runs a single Pod to completion, whereas more complex Jobs run multiple Pods, either sequentially or concurrently. When all containers in a Pod terminate with success, the Pod is considered completed. When all the Pods have completed, the Job itself is also completed.</p>
<p>Figure 17.1 Three different Job examples. Each Job is completed once its Pods have completed successfully.</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you might expect, a Job resource defines a Pod template and the number of Pods that must be successfully completed. It also defines the number of Pods that may run in parallel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE  </p>
<p>Unlike Deployments and other resources that contain a Pod template, you can&#x2019;t modify the template in a Job object after creating the object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&#x2019;s look at what the simplest Job object looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Defining a Job resource</strong></p>
<p>In this section, you take the <em>quiz-data-importer</em> Pod from chapter 15 and turn it into a Job. This Pod imports the data into the Quiz MongoDB database. You may recall that before running this Pod, you had to initiate the MongoDB replica set by issuing a command in one of the <em>quiz</em> Pods. You can do that in this Job as well, using an init container. The Job and the Pod it creates are visualized in the following figure.</p>
<p>Figure 17.2 An overview of the quiz-init Job</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The following listing shows the Job manifest, which you can find in the file <em>job.quiz-init.yaml</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE  </p>
<p>The manifest file also contains a ConfigMap in which the quiz questions are stored but this ConfigMap is not shown in the listing.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The manifest in the listing defines a Job object that runs a single Pod to completion. Jobs belong to the batch API group, and you&#x2019;re using API version <em>v1</em> to define the object. The Pod that this Job creates consists of two containers that execute in sequence, as one is an init and the other a normal container. The init container makes sure that the MongoDB replica set is initialized, then the main container imports the quiz questions from the <em>quiz-data</em> ConfigMap that&#x2019;s mounted into the container through a volume.</p>
<p>The Pod&#x2019;s <em>restartPolicy</em> is set to <em>OnFailure</em>. A Pod defined within a Job can&#x2019;t use the default policy of <em>Always</em>, as that would prevent the Pod from completing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE  </p>
<p>In a Job&#x2019;s pod <em>template</em>, you must explicitly set the restart policy to either <em>OnFailure</em> or <em>Never</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You&#x2019;ll notice that unlike Deployments, the Job manifest in the listing doesn&#x2019;t define a <em>selector</em>. While you can specify it, you don&#x2019;t have to, as Kubernetes sets it automatically. The Pod template in the listing does contain two labels, but they&#x2019;re there only for your convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Running a Job</strong></p>
<p>The Job controller creates the Pods immediately after you create the Job object. To run the <em>quiz-init</em> Job, apply the <em>job.quiz-init.yaml</em> manifest with <em>kubectl apply</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Displaying a brief Job status</strong></p>
<p>To get a brief overview of the Job&#x2019;s status, list the Jobs in the current Namespace as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get jobs
NAME        COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
quiz-init   0/1           3s         3s
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>COMPLETIONS</em> column indicates how many times the Job has run and how many times it&#x2019;s configured to complete. The DURATION column shows how long the Job has been running. Since the task the <em>quiz-init</em> Job performs is relatively short, its status should change within a few seconds. List the Jobs again to confirm this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get jobs
NAME        COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
quiz-init   1/1           6s         42s
</code></pre>
<p>The output shows that the Job is now complete, which took 6 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Displaying the detailed Job status</strong></p>
<p>To see more details about the Job, use the kubectl describe command as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl describe job quiz-init
Name:             quiz-init

</code></pre>
<p>In addition to the Job <em>name</em>, <em>namespace</em>, <em>labels</em>, <em>annotations</em>, and other properties, the output of the <em>kubectl describe</em> command also shows the selector that was automatically assigned. The <em>controller-uid</em> label used in the selector was also automatically added to the Job&#x2019;s Pod template. The <em>job-name</em> label was also added to the template. As you&#x2019;ll see in the next section, you can easily use this label to list the Pods that belong to a particular Job.</p>
<p>At the end of the <em>kubectl describe</em> output, you see the <em>Events</em> associated with this Job object. Only two events were generated for this Job: the creation of the Pod and the successful completion of the Job.</p>
<p><strong>Examining the Pods that belong to a Job</strong></p>
<p>To list the Pods created for a particular Job, you can use the job-name label that&#x2019;s automatically added to those Pods. To list the Pods of the quiz-init job, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get pods -l job-name=quiz-init
NAME              READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
quiz-init-xpl8d   0/1     Completed   0          25m
</code></pre>
<p>The pod shown in the output has finished its task. The Job controller doesn&#x2019;t delete the Pod, so you can see its status and view its logs.</p>
<p><strong>Examining the logs of a Job Pod</strong></p>
<p>The fastest way to see the logs of a Job is to pass the Job name instead of the Pod name to the kubectl logs command. To see the logs of the <em>quiz-init</em> Job, you could do something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl logs job/quiz-init --all-containers --prefix
[pod/quiz-init-xpl8d/init] Replica set initialized successfully!
[pod/quiz-init-xpl8d/import] 2022-10-02T10:51:01.967+0000  connected to: ...
[pod/quiz-init-xpl8d/import] 2022-10-02T10:51:01.969+0000  dropping: kiada.questions
[pod/quiz-init-xpl8d/import] 2022-10-02T10:51:03.811+0000  6 document(s) imported...
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>--all-containers</em> option tells <em>kubectl</em> to print the logs of all the Pod&#x2019;s containers, and the <em>--prefix</em> option ensures that each line is prefixed with the source, that is, the pod and container names.</p>
<p>The output contains both the init and the <em>import</em> container logs. These logs indicate that the MongoDB replica set has been successfully initialized and that the question database has been populated with data.</p>
<p><strong>Suspending active Jobs and creating Jobs in a suspended state</strong></p>
<p>When you created the <em>quiz-init</em> Job, the Job controller created the Pod as soon as you created the Job object. However, you can also create Jobs in a suspended state. Let&#x2019;s try this out by creating another Job. As you can see in the following listing, you suspend it by setting the suspend field to true. You can find this manifest in the file <em>job.demo-suspend.yaml</em>.</p>
<p>Listing 17.2 The manifest of a suspended Job</p>
<pre><code class="lang-yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">apiVersion:</span> batch/v1
<span class="hljs-attr">kind:</span> Job

<span class="hljs-attr">    spec:</span>

<span class="hljs-attr">        image:</span> busybox
<span class="hljs-attr">        command:</span>
<span class="hljs-bullet">        -</span> sleep
<span class="hljs-bullet">        -</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;60&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Apply the manifest in the listing to create the Job. List the Pods as follows to confirm that none have been created yet:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get po -l job-name=demo-suspend
No resources found in kiada namespace.
</code></pre>
<p>The Job controller generates an Event indicating the suspension of the Job. You can see it when you run <em>kubectl get events</em> or when you describe the Job with <em>kubectl describe</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl describe job demo-suspend
...
Events:
  Type    Reason     Age    From            Message
  ----    ------     ----   ----            -------
  Normal  Suspended  3m37s  job-controller  Job suspended
</code></pre>
<p>When you&#x2019;re ready to run the Job, you unsuspend it by patching the object as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl patch job demo-suspend -p &apos;{&quot;spec&quot;:{&quot;suspend&quot;: false}}&apos;
job.batch/demo-suspend patched
</code></pre>
<p>The Job controller creates the Pod and generates an Event indicating that the Job has resumed.</p>
<p>You can also suspend a running Job, whether you created it in a suspended state or not. To suspend a Job, set <em>suspend</em> to <em>true</em> with the following <em>kubectl patch</em> command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl patch job demo-suspend -p &apos;{&quot;spec&quot;:{&quot;suspend&quot;: true}}&apos;
job.batch/demo-suspend patched
</code></pre>
<p>The Job controller immediately deletes the Pod associated with the Job and generates an Event indicating that the Job has been suspended. The Pod&#x2019;s containers are shut down gracefully, as they are every time you delete a Pod, regardless of how it was created. You can resume the Job at your discretion by resetting the <em>suspend</em> field to <em>false</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting Jobs and their Pods</strong></p>
<p>You can delete a Job any time. Regardless of whether its Pods are still running or not, they&#x2019;re deleted in the same way as when you delete a Deployment, StatefulSet, or DaemonSet.</p>
<p>You don&#x2019;t need the <em>quiz-init</em> Job anymore, so delete it as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl delete job quiz-init
job.batch &quot;quiz-init&quot; deleted
</code></pre>
<p>Confirm that the Pod has also been deleted by listing the Pods as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get po -l job-name=quiz-init
No resources found in kiada namespace.
</code></pre>
<p>You may recall that Pods are deleted by the garbage collector because they&#x2019;re orphaned when their owner, in this case the Job object named <em>quiz-init</em>, is deleted. If you want to delete only the Job, but keep the Pods, you delete the Job with the <em>--cascade=orphan</em> option. You can try this method with the <em>demo-suspend</em> Job as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl delete job demo-suspend --cascade=orphan

job.batch &quot;demo-suspend&quot; deleted
</code></pre>
<p>If you now list Pods, you&#x2019;ll see that the Pod still exists. Since it&#x2019;s now a standalone Pod, it&#x2019;s up to you to delete it when you no longer need it.</p>
<p><strong>Automatically deleting Jobs</strong></p>
<p>By default, you must delete Job objects manually. However, you can flag the Job for automatic deletion by setting the <em>ttlSecondsAfterFinished</em> field in the Job&#x2019;s <em>spec</em>. As the name implies, this field specifies how long the Job and its Pods are kept after the Job is finished.</p>
<p>To see this setting in action, try creating the Job in the <em>job.demo-ttl.yaml</em> manifest. The Job will run a single Pod that will complete successfully after 20 seconds. Since ttlSecondsAfterFinished is set to <em>10</em>, the Job and its Pod are deleted ten seconds later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING</p>
<p>If you set the ttlSecondsAfterFinished field in a Job, the Job and its pods are deleted whether the Job completes successfully or not. If this happens before you can check the logs of the failed Pods, it&#x2019;s hard to determine what caused the Job to fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1712-running-a-task-multiple-times">17.1.2 Running a task multiple times</h2>
<p>In the previous section, you learned how to execute a task once. However, you can also configure the Job to execute the same task several times, either in parallel or sequentially. This may be necessary because the container running the task can only process a single item, so you need to run the container multiple times to process the entire input, or you may simply want to run the processing on multiple cluster nodes to improve performance.</p>
<p>You&#x2019;ll now create a Job that inserts fake responses into the Quiz database, simulating a large number of users. Instead of having only one Pod that inserts data into the database, as in the previous example, you&#x2019;ll configure the Job to create five such Pods. However, instead of running all five Pods simultaneously, you&#x2019;ll configure the Job to run at most two Pods at a time. The following listing shows the Job manifest. You can find it in the file <em>job.generate-responses.yaml</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to the Pod template, the Job manifest in the listing defines two new properties, <em>completions</em> and <em>parallelism</em>., which are explained next.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Job completions and parallelism</strong></p>
<p>The <em>completions</em> field specifies the number of Pods that must be successfully completed for this Job to be complete. The <em>parallelism</em> field specifies how many of these Pods may run in parallel. There is no upper limit to these values, but your cluster may only be able to run so many Pods in parallel.</p>
<p>You can set neither of these fields, one or the other, or both. If you don&#x2019;t set either field, both values are set to one by default. If you set only <em>completions</em>, this is the number of Pods that run one after the other. If you set only <em>parallelism</em>, this is the number of Pods that run, but only one must complete successfully for the Job to be complete.</p>
<p>If you set <em>parallelism</em> higher than completions, the Job controller creates only as many Pods as you specified in the <em>completions</em> field.</p>
<p>If <em>parallelism</em> is lower than <em>completions</em>, the Job controller runs at most <em>parallelism</em> Pods in parallel but creates additional Pods when those first Pods complete. It keeps creating new Pods until the number of successfully completed Pods matches <em>completions</em>. The following figure shows what happens when <em>completions</em> is 5 and <em>parallelism</em> is 2.</p>
<p>Figure 17.3 Running a parallel Job with completion=5 and parallelism=2</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As shown in the figure, the Job controller first creates two Pods and waits until one of them completes. In the figure, Pod 2 is the first to finish. The controller immediately creates the next Pod (Pod 3), bringing the number of running Pods back to two. The controller repeats this process until five Pods complete successfully.</p>
<p>The following table explains the behavior for different examples of <em>completions</em> and <em>parallelism</em>.</p>

<p>In the <em>generate-responses</em> Job that you&#x2019;re about to create, the number of <em>completions</em> is set to 5 and <em>parallelism</em> is set to 2, so at most two Pods will run in parallel. The Job isn&#x2019;t complete until five Pods complete successfully. The total number of Pods may end up being higher if some of the Pods fail. More on this in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Running the Job</strong>
Use <em>kubectl apply</em> to create the Job by applying the manifest file <em>job.generate-responses.yaml</em>. List the Pods while running the Job as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get po -l job-name=generate-responses
NAME                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS      AGE
generate-responses-7kqw4   1/1     Running     2 (20s ago)   27s
generate-responses-98mh8   0/1     Completed   0             27s
generate-responses-tbgns   1/1     Running     0             3s
</code></pre>
<p>List the Pods several times to observe the number Pods whose <em>STATUS</em> is shown as <em>Running</em> or <em>Completed</em>. As you can see, at any given time, at most two Pods run simultaneously. After some time, the Job completes. You can see this by displaying the Job status with the <em>kubectl get</em> command as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get job generate-responses
NAME                 COMPLETIONS   DURATION  AGE
generate-responses   5/5           110s      115s
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>COMPLETIONS</em> column shows that this Job completed five out of the desired five times, which took 110 seconds. If you list the Pods again, you should see five completed Pods, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get po -l job-name=generate-responses
NAME                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
generate-responses-5xtlk   0/1     Completed   0          82s
generate-responses-7kqw4   0/1     Completed   3          2m46s
generate-responses-98mh8   0/1     Completed   0          2m46s
generate-responses-tbgns   0/1     Completed   1          2m22s
generate-responses-vbvq8   0/1     Completed   1          111s
</code></pre>
<p>As indicated in the Job status earlier, you should see five <em>Completed</em> Pods. However, if you look closely at the <em>RESTARTS</em> column, you&#x2019;ll notice that some of these Pods had to be restarted. The reason for this is that I hard-coded a 25% failure rate into the code running in those Pods. I did this to show what happens when an error occurs.</p>
<h2 id="1713-understanding-how-job-failures-are-handled">17.1.3 Understanding how Job failures are handled</h2>
<p>As explained earlier, the reason for running tasks through a Job rather than directly through Pods is that Kubernetes ensures that the task is completed even if the individual Pods or their Nodes fail. However, there are two levels at which such failures are handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the Pod level.</li>
<li>At the Job level.</li>
<li>When a container in the Pod fails, the Pod&#x2019;s <em>restartPolicy</em> determines whether the failure is handled at the Pod level by the Kubelet or at the Job level by the Job controller. As you can see in the following figure, if the <em>restartPolicy</em> is <em>OnFailure</em>, the failed container is restarted within the same Pod. However, if the policy is <em>Never</em>, the entire Pod is marked as failed and the Job controller creates a new Pod.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 17.4 How failures are handled depending on the Pod&#x2019;s restart policy</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s examine the difference between these two scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Handling failures at the Pod level</strong></p>
<p>In the <em>generate-responses</em> Job you created in the previous section, the Pod&#x2019;s <em>restartPolicy</em> was set to <em>OnFailure</em>. As discussed earlier, whenever the container is executed, there is a 25% chance that it&#x2019;ll fail. In these cases, the container terminates with a non-zero exit code. The Kubelet notices the failure and restarts the container.</p>
<p>The new container runs in the same Pod on the same Node and therefore allows for a quick turnaround. The container may fail again and get restarted several times but will eventually terminate successfully and the Pod will be marked complete.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>As you learned in one of the previous chapters, the Kubelet doesn&#x2019;t restart the container immediately if it crashes multiple times, but adds a delay after each crash and doubles it after each restart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to see the Job controller handle the failures in the <em>generate-responses</em> Job, delete the existing Job and recreate it from the manifest file <em>job.generate-responses.restartPolicyNever.yaml</em>. In this manifest, the Pod&#x2019;s <em>restartPolicy</em> is set to Never.</p>
<p>The Job completes in about a minute or two. If you list the Pods as follows, you&#x2019;ll notice that it has now taken more than five Pods to get the job done.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get po -l job-name=generate-responses
NAME                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
generate-responses-2dbrn   0/1     Error       0          2m43s
generate-responses-4pckt   0/1     Error       0          2m39s
generate-responses-8c8wz   0/1     Completed   0          2m43s
generate-responses-bnm4t   0/1     Completed   0          3m10s
generate-responses-kn55w   0/1     Completed   0          2m16s
generate-responses-t2r67   0/1     Completed   0          3m10s
generate-responses-xpbnr   0/1     Completed   0          2m34s
</code></pre>
<p>You should see five <em>Completed</em> Pods and a few Pods whose status is <em>Error</em>. The number of those Pods should match the number of successful and failed Pods when you inspect the Job object using the kubectl describe job command as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl describe job generate-responses
...
Pods Statuses:    0 Active / 5 Succeeded / 2 Failed
...
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s possible that the number of Pods is different in your case. It&#x2019;s also possible that the Job isn&#x2019;t completed. This is explained in the next section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To conclude this section, delete the <em>generate-responses</em> Job.</p>
<p><strong>Preventing Jobs from failing indefinitely</strong>
The two Jobs you created in the previous sections may not have completed because they failed too many times. When that happens, the Job controller gives up. Let&#x2019;s demonstrate this by creating a Job that always fails. You can find the manifest in the file <em>job.demo-always-fails.yaml</em>. Its contents are shown in the following listing.</p>
<p>Listing 17.4 A Job that always fails</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: demo-always-fails
spec:
  completions: 10
  parallelism: 3
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
      containers:
      - name: demo
        image: busybox
        command:
        - &apos;false&apos;
</code></pre>
<p>When you create the Job in this manifest, the Job controller creates three Pods. The container in these Pods terminates with a non-zero exit code, which causes the Kubelet to restart it. After a few restarts, the Job controller notices that these Pods are failing, so it deletes them and marks the Job as failed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won&#x2019;t see that the controller has given up if you simply check the Job status with <em>kubectl get job</em>. When you run this command, you only see the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get job
NAME                COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
demo-always-fails   0/10          2m48s      2m48s
</code></pre>
<p>The output of the command indicates that the Job has zero completions, but it doesn&#x2019;t indicate whether the controller is still trying to complete the Job or has given up. You can, however, see this in the events associated with the Job. To see the events, run <em>kubectl describe</em> as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl describe job demo-always-fails
...
Events:
Type     Reason                Age    From            Message

                                                      limit
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>Warning</em> event at the bottom indicates that the backoff limit of the Job has been reached, which means that the Job has failed. You can confirm this by checking the Job status as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get job demo-always-fails -o yaml
...
status:
  conditions:
  - lastProbeTime: &quot;2022-10-02T15:42:39Z&quot;
    lastTransitionTime: &quot;2022-10-02T15:42:39Z&quot;
    message: Job has reached the specified backoff limit
    reason: BackoffLimitExceeded
    status: &quot;True&quot;
    type: Failed
  failed: 3
  startTime: &quot;2022-10-02T15:42:16Z&quot;
  uncountedTerminatedPods: {}
</code></pre>
<p>It&#x2019;s almost impossible to see this, but the Job ended after 6 retries, which is the default backoff limit. You can set this limit for each Job in the <em>spec.backoffLimit</em> field in its manifest.</p>
<p>Once a Job exceeds this limit, the Job controller deletes all running Pods and no longer creates new Pods for it. To restart a failed Job, you must delete and recreate it.</p>
<p><strong>Limiting the time allowed for a Job to complete</strong></p>
<p>Another way a Job can fail is if it doesn&#x2019;t finish on time. By default, this time isn&#x2019;t limited, but you can set the maximum time using the <em>activeDeadlineSeconds</em> field in the Job&#x2019;s <em>spec</em>, as shown in the following listing (see the manifest file <em>job.demo-deadline.yaml</em>):</p>
<p>Listing 17.5 A Job with a time limit</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: demo-deadline
spec:
  completions: 2
  parallelism: 1
  activeDeadlineSeconds: 90
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
      containers:
      - name: demo-suspend
        image: busybox
        command:
        - sleep
        - &quot;60&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>From the <em>completions</em> field shown in the listing, you can see that the Job requires two completions to be completed. Since <em>parallelism</em> is set to 1, the two Pods run one after the other. Given the sequential execution of these two Pods and the fact that each Pod needs 60 seconds to complete, the execution of the entire Job takes just over 120 seconds. However, since <em>activeDeadlineSeconds</em> for this Job is set to <em>90</em>, the Job can&#x2019;t be successful. The following figure illustrates this scenario.</p>
<p>Figure 17.5 Setting a time limit for a Job</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To see this for yourself, create this Job by applying the manifest and wait for it to fail. When it does, the following Event is generated by the Job controller:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl describe job demo-deadline
...
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age   From            Message

                                                   deadline
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>Remember that the <em>activeDeadlineSeconds</em> in a Job applies to the Job as a whole, not to the individual Pods created in the context of that Job.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1714-parameterizing-pods-in-a-job">17.1.4 Parameterizing Pods in a Job</h2>
<p>Until now, the tasks you performed in each Job were identical to each other. For example, the Pods in the generate-responses Job all did the same thing: they inserted a series of responses into the database. But what if you want to run a series of related tasks that aren&#x2019;t identical? Maybe you want each Pod to process only a subset of the data? That&#x2019;s where the Job&#x2019;s <em>completionMode</em> field comes in.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, two completion modes are supported: Indexed and NonIndexed. The Jobs you created so far in this chapter were NonIndexed, as this is the default mode. All Pods created by such a Job are indistinguishable from each other. However, if you set the Job&#x2019;s <em>completionMode</em> to Indexed, each Pod is given an index number that you can use to distinguish the Pods. This allows each Pod to perform only a portion of the entire task. See the following table for a comparison between the two completion modes.</p>
<p>Table 17.2 Supported Job completion modes</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NonIndexed</td>
<td>The Job is considered complete when the number of successfully completed Pods created by this Job equals the value of the <em>spec.completions</em> field in the Job manifest. All Pods are equal to each other. This is the default mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Indexed</td>
<td>Each Pod is given a completion index (starting at <em>0</em>) to distinguish the Pods from each other. The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index. If a Pod with a particular index fails, the Job controller creates a new Pod with the same index. The completion index assigned to each Pod is specified in the Pod annotation <em>batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index</em> and in the <em>JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX</em> environment variable in the Pod&#x2019;s containers.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>In the future, Kubernetes may support additional modes for Job processing, either through the built-in Job controller or through additional controllers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To better understand these completion modes, you&#x2019;ll create a Job that reads the responses in the Quiz database, calculates the number of valid and invalid responses for each day, and stores those results back in the database. You&#x2019;ll do this in two ways, using both completion modes so you understand the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Implementing the aggregation script</strong></p>
<p>As you can imagine, the Quiz database can get very large if many users are using the application. Therefore, you don&#x2019;t want a single Pod to process all the responses, but rather you want each Pod to process only a specific month.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve prepared a script that does this. The Pods will obtain this script from a ConfigMap. You can find its manifest in the file <em>cm.aggregate-responses.yaml</em>. The actual code is unimportant, but what is important is that it accepts two parameters: the year and month to process. The code reads these parameters via the environment variables <em>YEAR</em> and <em>MONTH</em>, as you can see in the following listing.</p>
<p>Listing 17.6 The ConfigMap with the MongoDB script for processing Quiz responses</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap    
metadata:
  name: aggregate-responses
  labels:
    app: aggregate-responses
data:
  script.js: |
    var year = parseInt(process.env[&quot;YEAR&quot;]);
    var month = parseInt(process.env[&quot;MONTH&quot;]);
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Apply this ConfigMap manifest to your cluster with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl apply -f cm.aggregate-responses.yaml 
configmap/aggregate-responses created
</code></pre>
<p>Now imagine you want to calculate the totals for each month of 2020. Since the script only processes a single month, you need 12 Pods to process the whole year. How should you create the Job to generate these Pods, since you need to pass a different month to each Pod?</p>
<p><strong>The NonIndexed completion mode</strong></p>
<p>Before completionMode support was added to the Job resource, all Jobs operated in the so called NonIndexed mode. The problem with this mode is that all generated Pods are identical.</p>
<p>Figure 17.6 Jobs using the NonIndexed completionMode spawn identical Pods</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, if you use this completion mode, you can&#x2019;t pass a different <em>MONTH</em> value to each Pod. You must create a separate Job object for each month. This way, each Job can set the MONTH environment variable in the Pod template to a different value, as shown in the following figure.</p>
<p>Figure 17.7 Creating similar Jobs from a template</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To create these different Jobs, you need to create separate Job manifests. You can do this manually or using an external templating system. Kubernetes itself doesn&#x2019;t provide any functionality for creating Jobs from templates.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s return to our example with the <em>aggregate-responses</em> Job. To process the entire year 2020, you need to create twelve Job manifests. You could use a full-blown template engine for this, but you can also do it with a relatively simple shell command.</p>
<p>First you must create the template. You can find it in the file <em>job.aggregate-responses-2020.tmpl.yaml</em>. The following listing shows how it looks.</p>

<p>If you use Bash, you can create the manifests from this template and apply them directly to the cluster with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ for month in {1..12}; do \
    sed -e &quot;s/__MONTH__/$month/g&quot; job.aggregate-responses-2020.tmpl.yaml \
    | kubectl apply -f - ; \
  done
job.batch/aggregate-responses-2020-1 created
job.batch/aggregate-responses-2020-2 created
...
job.batch/aggregate-responses-2020-12 created
</code></pre>
<p>This command uses a for loop to render the template twelve times. Rendering the template simply means replacing the string <strong>MONTH</strong> in the template with the actual month number. The resulting manifest is applied to the cluster using <em>kubectl apply</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>If you want to run this example but don&#x2019;t use Linux, you can use the manifests I created for you. Use the following command to apply them to your cluster: <em>kubectl apply -f job.aggregate-responses-2020.generated.yaml</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The twelve Jobs you just created are now running in your cluster. Each Job creates a single Pod that processes a specific month. To see the generated statistics, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl exec quiz-0 -c mongo -- mongosh kiada --quiet --eval &apos;db.statistics.find()&apos;
[
  {
    _id: ISODate(&quot;2020-02-28T00:00:00.000Z&quot;),
    totalCount: 120,
    correctCount: 25,
    incorrectCount: 95
  },
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>If all twelve Jobs processed their respective months, you should see many entries like the one shown here. You can now delete all twelve <em>aggregate-responses</em> Jobs as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl delete jobs -l app=aggregate-responses
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the parameter passed to each Job was a simple integer, but the real advantage of this approach is that you can pass any value or set of values to each Job and its Pod. The disadvantage, of course, is that you end up with more than one Job, which means more work compared to managing a single Job object. And if you create those Job objects at the same time, they will all run at the same time. That&#x2019;s why creating a single Job using the Indexed completion mode is the better option, as you&#x2019;ll see next.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing the Indexed completion mode</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, when a Job is configured with the Indexed completion mode, each Pod is assigned a completion index (starting at 0) that distinguishes the Pod from the other Pods in the same Job, as shown in the following figure.</p>
<p>Figure 17.8 Pods spawned by a Job with the Indexed completion mode each get their own index number</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The number of Pods is determined by the <em>completions</em> field in the Job&#x2019;s <em>spec</em>. The Job is considered completed when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index.</p>
<p>The following listing shows a Job manifest that uses the Indexed completion mode to run twelve Pods, one for each month. Note that the MONTH environment variable isn&#x2019;t set. This is because the script, as you&#x2019;ll see later, uses the completion index to determine the month to process.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>In the listing, the completionMode is Indexed and the number of completions is 12, as you might expect. To run three Pods in parallel, parallelism is set to 3.</p>
<p><strong>The JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX environment variable</strong></p>
<p>Unlike in the aggregate-responses-2020 example, in which you passed in both the YEAR and MONTH environment variables, here you pass in only the YEAR variable. To determine which month the Pod should process, the script looks up the environment variable JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX, as shown in the following listing.</p>
<p>Listing 17.9 Using the JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX environment variable in your code</p>
<pre><code class="lang-yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">apiVersion:</span> v1
<span class="hljs-attr">kind:</span> ConfigMap
<span class="hljs-attr">metadata:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  name:</span> aggregate-responses-indexed

<span class="hljs-attr">    app:</span> aggregate-responses-indexed

    var year = parseInt(process.env[&quot;YEAR&quot;]);
    var month = parseInt(process.env[&quot;JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX&quot;]) + 1;
    ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>This environment variable isn&#x2019;t specified in the Pod template but is added to each Pod by the Job controller. The workload running in the Pod can use this variable to determine which part of a dataset to process.</p>
<p>In the aggregate-responses example, the value of the variable represents the month number. However, because the environment variable is zero-based, the script must increment the value by 1 to get the month.</p>
<p><strong>The job-completion-index annotation</strong></p>
<p>In addition to setting the environment variable, the Job controller also sets the job completion index in the <em>batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index</em> annotation of the Pod. Instead of using the <em>JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX</em> environment variable, you can pass the index via any environment variable by using the Downward API, as explained in chapter 9. For example, to pass the value of this annotation to the <em>MONTH</em> environment variable, the env entry in the Pod template would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">env:</span>        
<span class="hljs-attr">- name:</span> MONTH
<span class="hljs-attr">  valueFrom:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">    fieldRef:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">      fieldPath:</span> metadata.annotations[<span class="hljs-string">&apos;batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index&apos;</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>You might think that with this approach you could just use the same script as in the <em>aggregate-responses-2020</em> example, but that&#x2019;s not the case. Since you can&#x2019;t do math when using the Downward API, you&#x2019;d have to modify the script to properly handle the MONTH environment variable, which starts at 0 instead of 1.</p>
<p>Running an Indexed Job
To run this indexed variant of the <em>aggregate-responses Job</em>, apply the manifest file <em>job.aggregate-responses-2021-indexed.yaml</em>. You can then track the created Pods by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get pods -l job-name=aggregate-responses-2021
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
aggregate-responses-2021-0-kptfr   1/1     Running   0          24s
aggregate-responses-2021-1-r4vfq   1/1     Running   0          24s
aggregate-responses-2021-2-snz4m   1/1     Running   0          24s
</code></pre>
<p>Did you notice that the Pod names contain the job completion index? The Job name is <em>aggregate-responses-2021</em>, but the Pod names are in the form <em>aggregate-responses-2021-\<index\>-\<random string\=""></random></index\></em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>The completion index also appears in the Pod hostname. The hostname is of the form <em>\<job-name\>-\<index\></index\></job-name\></em>. This facilitates communication between Pods of an indexed Job, as you&#x2019;ll see in a later section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now check the Job status with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get jobs
NAME                       COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
aggregate-responses-2021   7/12          2m17s      2m17s
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike the example where you used multiple Jobs with the NonIndexed completion mode, all the work is done with a single Job object, which makes things much more manageable. Although there are still twelve Pods, you don&#x2019;t have to care about them unless the Job fails. When you see that the Job is completed, you can be sure that the task is done, and you can delete the Job to clean everything up.</p>
<p>Using the job completion index in more advanced use-cases
In the previous example, the code in the workload used the job completion index directly as input. But what about tasks where the input isn&#x2019;t a simple number?</p>
<p>For example, imagine a container image that accepts an input file and processes it in some way. It expects the file to be in a certain location and have a certain name. Suppose the file is called <em>/var/input/file.bin</em>. You want to use this image to process 1000 files. Can you do that with an indexed job without changing the code in the image?</p>
<p>Yes, you can! By adding an init container and a volume to the Pod template. You create a Job with completionMode set to <em>Indexed</em> and <em>completions</em> set to <em>1000</em>. In the Job&#x2019;s Pod template, you add two containers and a volume that is shared by these two containers. One container runs the image that processes the file. Let&#x2019;s call this the main container. The other container is an init container that reads the completion index from the environment variable and prepares the input file on the shared volume.</p>
<p>If the thousand files you need to process are on a network volume, you can also mount that volume in the Pod and have the init container create a symbolic link named <em>file.bin</em> in the Pod&#x2019;s shared internal volume to one of the files in the network volume. The init container must make sure that each completion index corresponds to a different file in the network volume.</p>
<p>If the internal volume is mounted in the main container at <em>/var/input</em>, the main container can process the file without knowing anything about the completion index or the fact that there are a thousand files being processed. The following figure shows how all this would look.</p>
<p>Figure 17.9 An init container providing the input file to the main container based on the job completion index</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, even though an indexed Job provides only a simple integer to each Pod, there is a way to use that integer to prepare much more complex input data for the workload. All you need is an init container that transforms the integer into this input data.</p>
<h2 id="1715-running-jobs-with-a-work-queue">17.1.5 Running Jobs with a work queue</h2>
<p>The Jobs in the previous section were assigned static work. However, often the work to be performed is assigned dynamically using a work queue. Instead of specifying the input data in the Job itself, the Pod retrieves that data from the queue. In this section, you&#x2019;ll learn two methods for processing a work queue in a Job.</p>
<p>The previous paragraph may have given the impression that Kubernetes itself provides some kind of queue-based processing, but that isn&#x2019;t the case. When we talk about Jobs that use a queue, the queue and the component that retrieves the work items from that queue need to be implemented in your containers. Then you create a Job that runs those containers in one or more Pods. To learn how to do this, you&#x2019;ll now implement another variant of the aggregate-responses Job. This one uses a queue as the source of the work to be executed.</p>
<p>There are two ways to process a work queue: coarse or fine. The following figure illustrates the difference between these two methods.</p>
<p>Figure 17.10 The difference between coarse and fine parallel processing</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In coarse parallel processing, each Pod takes an item from the queue, processes it, and then terminates. Therefore, you end up with one Pod per work item. In contrast, in fine parallel processing, typically only a handful of Pods are created and each Pod processes multiple work items. They all work in parallel until the entire queue is processed. In both methods, you can run as many Pods in parallel as you want, if your cluster can accommodate them.</p>
<p><strong>Creating the work queue</strong></p>
<p>The Job you&#x2019;ll create for this exercise will process the Quiz responses from 2022. Before you create this Job, you must first set up the work queue. To keep things simple, you implement the queue in the existing MongoDB database. To create the queue, you run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl exec -it quiz-0 -c mongo -- mongosh kiada --eval &apos;
  db.monthsToProcess.insertMany([
    {_id: &quot;2022-01&quot;, year: 2022, month: 1},
    {_id: &quot;2022-02&quot;, year: 2022, month: 2},
    {_id: &quot;2022-03&quot;, year: 2022, month: 3},
    {_id: &quot;2022-04&quot;, year: 2022, month: 4},
    {_id: &quot;2022-05&quot;, year: 2022, month: 5},
    {_id: &quot;2022-06&quot;, year: 2022, month: 6},
    {_id: &quot;2022-07&quot;, year: 2022, month: 7},
    {_id: &quot;2022-08&quot;, year: 2022, month: 8},
    {_id: &quot;2022-09&quot;, year: 2022, month: 9},
    {_id: &quot;2022-10&quot;, year: 2022, month: 10},
    {_id: &quot;2022-11&quot;, year: 2022, month: 11},
    {_id: &quot;2022-12&quot;, year: 2022, month: 12}])&apos;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>This command assumes that quiz-0 is the primary MongoDB replica. If the command fails with the error message &#x201C;not primary&#x201D;, try running the command in all three Pods, or you can ask MongoDB which of the three is the primary replica with the following command: kubectl exec quiz-0 -c mongo -&#x2013; mongosh &#x2013;-eval &apos;rs.hello().primary&apos;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The command inserts 12 work items into the MongoDB collection named <em>monthsToProcess</em>. Each work item represents a particular month that needs to be processed.</p>
<p><strong>Processing a work queue using coarse parallel processing</strong></p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s start with an example of coarse parallel processing, where each Pod processes only a single work item. You can find the Job manifest in the file <em>job.aggregate-responses-queue-coarse.yaml</em> and is shown in the following listing.</p>

<p>The Job creates Pods that run a script in MongoDB that takes a single item from the queue and processes it. Note that <em>completions</em> is <em>6</em>, meaning that this Job only processes 6 of the 12 items you added to the queue. The reason for this is that I want to leave a few items for the fine parallel processing example that comes after this one.</p>
<p>The <em>parallelism</em> setting for this Job is <em>3</em>, which means that three work items are processed in parallel by three different Pods.</p>
<p>The script that each Pod executes is defined in the <em>aggregate-responses-queue-coarse</em> ConfigMap. The manifest for this ConfigMap is in the same file as the Job manifest. A rough outline of the script can be seen in the following listing.</p>

<p>The script takes an item from the work queue. As you know, each item represents a single month. The script performs an aggregation query on the Quiz responses for that month that calculates the number of correct, incorrect, and total responses, and stores the result back in MongoDB.</p>
<p>To run the Job, apply <em>job.aggregate-responses-queue-coarse.yaml</em> with kubectl apply and observe the status of the Job with kubectl get jobs. You can also check the Pods to make sure that three Pods are running in parallel, and that the total number of Pods is six after the Job is complete.</p>
<p>If all goes well, your work queue should now only contain the 6 months that haven&#x2019;t been processed by the Job. You can confirm this by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl exec quiz-0 -c mongo -- mongosh kiada --quiet --eval &apos;db.monthsToProcess.find()&apos;
[
  { _id: &apos;2022-07&apos;, year: 2022, month: 7 },

  { _id: &apos;2022-09&apos;, year: 2022, month: 9 },
  { _id: &apos;2022-10&apos;, year: 2022, month: 10 },
  { _id: &apos;2022-11&apos;, year: 2022, month: 11 },
  { _id: &apos;2022-12&apos;, year: 2022, month: 12 }
]
</code></pre>
<p>You can check the logs of the six Pods to see if they have processed the exact months for which the items were removed from the queue. You&#x2019;ll process the remaining items with fine parallel processing. Before you continue, please delete the <em>aggregate-responses-queue-coarse</em> Job with <em>kubectl delete</em>. This also removes the six Pods.</p>
<p><strong>Processing a work queue using fine parallel processing</strong></p>
<p>In fine parallel processing, each Pod handles multiple work items. It takes an item from the queue, processes it, takes the next item, and repeats this process until there are no items left in the queue. As before, multiple Pods can work in parallel.</p>
<p>The Job manifest is in the file <em>job.aggregate-responses-queue-fine.yaml</em>. The Pod template is virtually the same as in the previous example, but it doesn&#x2019;t contain the completions field, as you can see in the following listing.</p>

<p>A Job that uses fine parallel processing doesn&#x2019;t set the <em>completions</em> field because a single successful completion indicates that all the items in the queue have been processed. This is because the Pod terminates with success when it has processed the last work item.</p>
<p>You may wonder what happens if some Pods are still processing their items when another Pod reports success. Fortunately, the Job controller lets the other Pods finish their work. It doesn&#x2019;t kill them.</p>
<p>As before, the manifest file also contains a ConfigMap that contains the MongoDB script. Unlike the previous script, this script processes one work item after the other until the queue is empty, as shown in the following listing.</p>

<p>The status of the Job also indicates that all three Pods have completed:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get jobs
NAME                             COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
aggregate-responses-queue-fine   3/1 of 3      3m19s      5m34s
</code></pre>
<p>The last thing you need to do is check if the work queue is actually empty. You can do that with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl exec quiz-1 -c mongo -- mongosh kiada --quiet --eval &apos;db.monthsToProcess.countDocuments()&apos;
0
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the queue is zero, so the Job is completed.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous processing of work queues</strong></p>
<p>To conclude this section on Jobs with work queues, let&#x2019;s see what happens when you add items to the queue after the Job is complete. Add a work item for January 2023 as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl exec -it quiz-0 -c mongo -- mongosh kiada --quiet --eval &apos;db.monthsToProcess.insertOne({_id: &quot;2023-01&quot;, year: 2023, month: 1})&apos;
{ acknowledged: true, insertedId: &apos;2023-01&apos; }
</code></pre>
<p>Do you think the Job will create another Pod to handle this work item? The answer is obvious when you consider that Kubernetes doesn&#x2019;t know anything about the queue, as I explained earlier. Only the containers running in the Pods know about the existence of the queue. So, of course, if you add a new item after the Job finishes, it won&#x2019;t be processed unless you recreate the Job.</p>
<p>Remember that Jobs are designed to run tasks to completion, not continuously. To implement a worker Pod that continuously monitors a queue, you should run the Pod with a Deployment instead. However, if you want to run the Job at regular intervals rather than continuously, you can also use a CronJob, as explained in the second part of this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="1716-communication-between-job-pods">17.1.6 Communication between Job Pods</h2>
<p>Most Pods running in the context of a Job run independently, unaware of the other Pods running in the same context. However, some tasks require that these Pods communicate with each other.</p>
<p>In most cases, each Pod needs to communicate with a specific Pod or with all its peers, not just with a random Pod in the group. Fortunately, it&#x2019;s trivial to enable this kind of communication. You only have to do three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the completionMode of the Job to Indexed.</li>
<li>Create a headless Service.</li>
<li>Configure this Service as a subdomain in the Pod template.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me explain this with an example.</p>
<p><strong>Creating the headless Service manifest</strong></p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s first look at how the headless Service must be configured. Its manifest is shown in the following listing.</p>
<p>Listing 17.14 Headless Service for communication between Job Pods</p>
<pre><code class="lang-yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">apiVersion:</span> v1
<span class="hljs-attr">kind:</span> Service
<span class="hljs-attr">metadata:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  name:</span> demo-service
<span class="hljs-attr">spec:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  clusterIP:</span> none
<span class="hljs-attr">  selector:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">    job-name:</span> comm-demo
<span class="hljs-attr">  ports:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  - name:</span> http
<span class="hljs-attr">    port:</span> <span class="hljs-number">80</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you learned in chapter 11, you must set <em>clusterIP</em> to none to make the Service headless. You also need to make sure that the label selector matches the Pods that the Job creates. The easiest way to do this is to use the <em>job-name</em> label in the selector. You learned at the beginning of this chapter that this label is automatically added to the Pods. The value of the label is set to the name of the Job object, so you need to make sure that the value you use in the selector matches the Job name.</p>
<p><strong>Creating the Job manifest</strong></p>
<p>Now let&#x2019;s see how the Job manifest must be configured. Examine the following listing.</p>
<p>Listing 17.15 A Job manifest enabling pod-to-pod communication</p>
<pre><code class="lang-yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">apiVersion:</span> batch/v1
<span class="hljs-attr">kind:</span> Job
<span class="hljs-attr">metadata:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  name:</span> comm-demo
<span class="hljs-attr">spec:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  completionMode:</span> Indexed
<span class="hljs-attr">  completions:</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  parallelism:</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  template:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">    spec:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">      subdomain:</span> demo-service
<span class="hljs-attr">      restartPolicy:</span> Never
<span class="hljs-attr">      containers:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">      - name:</span> comm-demo
<span class="hljs-attr">        image:</span> busybox
<span class="hljs-attr">        command:</span>
<span class="hljs-bullet">        -</span> sleep
<span class="hljs-bullet">        -</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;600&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the completion mode must be set to <em>Indexed</em>. This Job is configured to run two Pods in parallel so you can experiment with them. In order for the Pods to find each other via DNS, you need to set their <em>subdomain</em> to the name of the headless Service.</p>
<p>You can find both the Job and the Service manifest in the <em>job.comm-demo.yaml</em> file. Create the two objects by applying the file and then list the Pods as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get pods -l job-name=comm-demo
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
comm-demo-0-mrvlp   1/1     Running   0          34s
comm-demo-1-kvpb4   1/1     Running   0          34s
</code></pre>
<p>Note the names of the two Pods. You need them to execute commands in their containers.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting to Pods from other Pods</strong></p>
<p>Check the hostname of the first Pod with the following command. Use the name of your Pod.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl exec comm-demo-0-mrvlp -- hostname -f
comm-demo-0.demo-service.kiada.svc.cluster.local
</code></pre>
<p>The second Pod can communicate with the first Pod at this address. To confirm this, try pinging the first Pod from the second Pod using the following command (this time, pass the name of your second Pod to the <em>kubectl exec</em> command):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl exec comm-demo-1-kvpb4 -- ping comm-demo-0.demo-service.kiada.svc.cluster.local
PING comm-demo-0.demo-service.kiada.svc.cluster.local (10.244.2.71): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.244.2.71: seq=0 ttl=63 time=0.060 ms
64 bytes from 10.244.2.71: seq=1 ttl=63 time=0.062 ms
...
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the second Pod can communicate with the first Pod without knowing its exact name, which is known to be random. A pod running in the context of a Job can determine the names of its peers according to the following pattern:</p>
<p><img src="../images/17.10.1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But you can simplify the address even further. As you may recall, when resolving DNS records for objects in the same Namespace, you don&#x2019;t have to use the fully qualified domain name. You can omit the Namespace and the cluster domain suffix. So the second Pod can connect to the first Pod using the address <em>comm-demo-0.demo-service</em>, as shown in the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl exec comm-demo-1-kvpb4 -- ping comm-demo-0.demo-service
PING comm-demo-0.demo-service (10.244.2.71): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.244.2.71: seq=0 ttl=63 time=0.040 ms
64 bytes from 10.244.2.71: seq=1 ttl=63 time=0.067 ms
...
</code></pre>
<p>As long as the Pods know how many Pods belong to the same Job (in other words, what the value of the <em>completions</em> field is), they can easily find all their peers via DNS. They don&#x2019;t need to ask the Kubernetes API server for their names or IP addresses.</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of this chapter. Please delete any remaining Jobs before continuing.</p>
